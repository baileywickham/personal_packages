My dotfiles and install scripts

## Layout
- `bin/` scripts for my machine
- `config/` my dotfiles
- `files/` config files, keyboard layout, etc...
- `modules/` specific install scripts
- `scripts/` useful scripts for this repo

### Modules
To add an install script, add a `.sh` file to `modules/`. The `personal_packages.sh` script automaticly call the function matching the name of the file for all files in the `modules` directory. Ex: `install_zsh` in `modules/install_zsh.sh` will be automaticly called.

## Use
Run `./personal_packages.sh -h` to see the options available.

Commonly used bash utils are stored in the utils.sh file, they can be included in any repo with the following script.
```bash
if [ -f utils.sh ]; then
    source utils.sh
else
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baileywickham/personal_packages/master/utils.sh > utils.sh
    source utils.sh
fi
```


### Running
There should be as few dependencies as possible to the actual script, bash and git are all you need
```bash
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/baileywickham/personal_packages.git ~/workspace/personal_packages && \
cd ~/workspace/personal_packages && ./personal_packages.sh -a
```
To install the packages and move the dotfiles.

### Features
This installs my custom keyboard, bashrc, vimrc, tmux.conf, 2fa files and all packages I want.

## Docker
Use:
```bash
./dock.sh
```
This repo includes a dockerfile and a script, ```dock.sh``` which runs the dockerfile. I am using docker as a test enviroment for making changes to the os, without breaking my configs.

## One liners
